This follows recent articles by the journalist Steve Levine discussing the growing interest in this possibility, and the solid-state company QuantumScape also announcing they were looking into this.\n",

    "Here we will use the `PouchCell` model. This is of course defined a bit differently from the cylindrical cell. It assumes a rectangular, stacked cell, with 0.5 mm thick tabs of Al and Ni to contact the electrodes. At the moment, the `PouchCell` can only be defined with a set number of layers, rather than a maximum thickness, unlike the other models which all fit the electrodes into a constrained space. I will likely update this later, but for the moment this results in cells which can vary in thickness depending on the materials used.\n",

    "The model is constructed with electrodes similar to those used in the Quickstart guide. We are assuming a typical automotive-size format, 30 x 10 cm, and 35 layers, which should give us a thickness around 1 cm. The pouch is assumed to be 113 Âµm thick Al/polymer laminate with an average density of 1.8 g/cm, and the pouch extending 1 cm from the jelly roll on the long and wide sides. The terminals are 2 x 5 cm each, and we are assuming 10 Â± 10 g of unaccounted-for mass."

    "So, the results of comparing LFP with NMC811, all other parameters being the same, gives the LFP cell with an energy density of 208 Wh/kg, 451 Wh/L. These numbers are fairly similar to some of the state of the art LFP cells coming out now, so I think we can treat these as reasonable as well. The LFP cell has a bit lower energy as a result of the lower average voltage, and the lower density and capacity of LFP means that to reach 3.3 mAh/cm2, the electrode needs to be 84 Âµm thick compared to 51 Âµm for the NMC811. This makes the cell thicker, so the ratio of the volumetric energy to gravimetric is lower for LFP."

With sulfide electrolytes, they could be higher still.\n",
